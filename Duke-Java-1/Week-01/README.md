# Week 01

## Shapes (Polygons): Collections of Points

### Triangle

- Collection of three points

- Basis for complex and wireframe models

### Circle

- Infinite collection of points that are the same distance from the cenre of a circle
- However, Java class is just a finite collection of points

## Why Semantics: Motivation to Read Code

### Semantic

- Basically means "meaning" of each part of the code
- How to execute it step-by-step by hand using pen and paper only

## Variables

### Default Value

- When a variable is declared using programming language like C, no default value is given
	- Java provides two solutions:
		1. an initial default value of 0 is given to instance variables
		2. an explicit error is given for using a local variable

```java
int x = 4;
int y = x + 2;
int z = x + y;
```

- In the above example, declaration and initialization are combined into the same statement
